    title: "Can we colonize Mars?",
    frontImage: "./assets/articleImages/canWeColonizeMars.jpg",
    introduction:
      "For the past years space associations have planned to colonize Mars in the near future, with the first mission being estimated to launch in the years 2030s. Although colonising other planets is becoming closer to reality than science fiction, going to Mars would not be beneficial.",
    background: "",
    main: " Mars is the fourth planet of our solar system, about 228 million km (1.5 AU) from the Sun. Even though it is a rocky planet like the Earth, it is vey different and these differences are what make future missions to go to Mars a big risk. Mars is a sterile planet. It is dry, cold and the presence of liquid water is absent. Water in its liquid form does exist on Mars, but it is located in the polar caps in the form of ice. Polar caps though are mostly composed of dry ice (carbon dioxide ice) so the water available is not much. In order to grow crops and plants water is necessary but since the availability is low, they would most likely need regular &#39;shipments&#39; from the Earth to bring in resources and equipment in order to sustain the people, the colonial bases, and the plants they grow. Since the atmosphere is thin, there is very little greenhouse effect and this causes the planet to be generally cold, with temperatures which range between -140 C° (-220 F) and 21 C° (70 F), with an average temperature ranging around -62 C° (-81 F). Humans have evolved to survive Earth, but we did not evolve to survive on Mars. Respiration is one of most basic functions for any living being on Earth. Mars has a very thin atmosphere (about 100 times less thick than Earth&#39;s) and it is mainly composed of carbon dioxide (95%), nitrogen (2.7%), argon (1.6%), and oxygen (only 0.13%). Oxygen can always be made by using the carbon dioxide in Mars&#39; atmosphere but that&#39;s no easy task as it would be expensive and hard to bring machineries big enough to produce a sustainable amount of oxygen in the colonial bases. Not to mention the weight of the equipment would be extremely challenging,costly, and time consuming as these would need to come directly from Earth. It is also important to take into consideration the radiation on the planet. Growing plants will probably be a big challenge but they, like the colonizer, also need protection from the damaging incoming radiation.Radiation levels on Mars are 45 times higher than on Earth for three reasons: It lacks of a thick atmosphere; It lacks of an ozone layer; It lacks of an iron-core dynamo; The Earth has a thin layer of ozone (a molecule made up by three oxygen atoms) which absorbs most of the incoming UV radiation, protecting all life on Earth. UV radiation is a very damaging (especially to DNA) non-ionizing radiation produced by the Sun. As Mars has a thin atmosphere (which lacks of an ozone layer) there is no protection from the harms of UV radiation. Mars used to have a thick atmosphere 4 billion years ago but lost it over time. Initially Mars, like the Earth, had an iron-core dynamo, which means it had protection against  cosmic radiation and solar wind but the core cooled down and Mars lost its magnetosphere. As the Sun continued to emit solar wind and charged particles, Mars also continued to get bombarded by these energy sources.  Some of the electrons carried by solar wind were captured by the upper atmosphere, which turns molecules located in the upper parts of the atmosphere into plasma. Consequently, as plasma is extremely conductive, electric currents are formed. Today Mars has an induced magnetic field, which is formed because part of the incoming solar wind, with the magnetic field, are being enveloped by the electric currents formed by the plasma. This still is not enough to protect the planet, as it is counterintuitively thinning the atmosphere since it causes atoms to become more energetic, obtaining the necessary velocity to escape into space. There seems to be many problems involved when planning to colonise Mars.It is a harsh, deadly environment which is not suited for life as we know it. Colonising Mars will be challenging, time consuming, expensive beyond imagination and doubtfully would be a positive improvement to civilization, at this time, since colonies will most likely be highly dependent on Earth for many decades.

    conclusion:
      "So, should we go to Mars? The answer in my opinion is yes, but the current technology, social and  political implications indicate it is still too early to take such a big step. Moving to Mars would mean learning how to terraform an entire, sterile, new world and currently we can barely keep control over our own planet (the ozone layer hole, pollution, global warming…). Are we really ready for this kind of journey?",

    title: "The importance of Astronomy",
    frontImage: "./theImportanceOfAstronomy.jpg",
    introduction:
      "Astronomy has been exponentially developing over the course of time and has been a tool used for our survival since the rise of mankind. It was used for predicting events on Earth, navigate the globe, anticipate astronomical events, and much more.",
    background: "",
    main: "Astronomy has helped us evolve over the centuries. Without astronomy we would have never known that the Sun is star like any other in our galaxy and in neighbouring galaxies and that we orbit around it along other seven planets. Astronomy studies the entire universe, how it started, how it developed, how it will likely end and all the things that are found within it. It also helps us understand how our Solar System evolved, how other solar systems may develop, and how we got this far. Astronomy is a science, but it has also been one of the most useful tools to our society and human development, both directly and indirectly. Picture The study of our nearest star, the Sun, is a very important part of the field beneficial to our society. Without it we wouldn’t be able to predict the Sun’s behaviour, its effects on the Earth and the life on it, how it affects seasons, the weather, and the water cycle of the planet. It also helps us predict any future threat it may cause the Earth. ​Another important contribution that astronomy has given is the ability to study the motion of the celestial bodies around us. Some of these include bodies called asteroids which hit our planet on a daily basis but, as these are extremely small in size, they do not generally cause concern or threat as they disintegrate through the atmosphere and never hit the surface. On the other hand, there are asteroids out there that are dangerously large, in fact these can be hundreds of metres across in diameter, while some even have diameters tens of kilometres across. Fortunately, most of them will most likely never reach the Earth though there are some Near Earth Objects (NEO) that could potentially collide with the Earth in the future. By studying the impacted asteroids on Earth (meteorites) we have been able to create a predicting pattern that can give us an idea on how often and likely it is for an asteroid of a certain diameter to hit the Earth. Asteroids with a 1 km diameter hit us, on average, every 500,000 years and can cause destruction throughout regions,and even continents also causing climatic changes, potentially killing millions of people in the process. Larger asteroids with a 5 km radius hit us every 20 million years, while 10+ km asteroid impact our planet every 100 million years, with the last one being 66 million years ago (causing the extinction of the dinosaurs). Astronomy can help us find large NEOs, predict their orbits, and possibly stop them before they hit our planet. There are currently more than 20,000 NEOs known objects, but there could be more that we may have not discovered yet. Picture One other way Astronomy has helped us is grow was by the development over time of instruments ever more advanced than previous ones, contributing to the advancement of the field, but also developing the technological advances of instruments and software which can also be applied to other fields. For example, since the first telescope was invented it has pushed us to develop more potent ones now able to see billions of years across space. If it wasn’t for that first telescope, we might have not have today some of the most advanced telescopes ever created, such as MeerKAT, the Keck telescopes, or the most recent James Webb Space Telescope. These are all results of the technological advancement made in the field of astronomy (and others such as engineering, programming, physics, math…). The advancement of one field causes other fields to advance both technologically and economically. This has helped us gain unimaginable knowledge throughout the decades and develop a growing economical system. Another benefit that Astronomy has brought to society is the maths and physics behind it. Without it we wouldn’t have been able to develop those precious satellites that allow us to communicate with one another from anywhere in the globe or the invention of GPS systems so that never get us lost. Magnetic Resonance Imaging scanners is also a technology invented contributing to study the Earth, but as you may know this technology has also been applied in other fields such as medicine (MRI machines).",

    conclusion:
      "Astronomy allows us to understand the universe we live in. This field has helped us create instruments letting us being able to study the universe around us. We have been able to prove many scientific theories, such as Einstein’s prediction of how a black hole would look like, we were able to discover extra-solar planets orbiting alien stars, and we are able to predict what will happen to our Sun. Astronomy is not only useful to our technological, scientific, and cultural development but it is also necessary to our survival.",
